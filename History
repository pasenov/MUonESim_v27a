10/12/2020 Version 1: Project created.

10/1/2021 Version 2: Energy > 1 GeV cut included for all histograms. Process ID is saved in Histogram 11, where: 	          
processID = 1; //ionization
processID = 2; //pair production
processID = 3; //Bremsstrahlung
processID = 4; //nuclear interaction

19/1/2021 Version 3: Axis range in some energy histograms increased.

26/1/2021 Version 4: 2D plot axes swapped. nTuple added.

26/1/2021 Version 5: Angles and energies calculated for all charged particles at target's exit.

27/1/2021 Version 6: Charged track multiplicity counted.

2/2/2021 Version 7: Angles and energies calculated for each process separately.

17/2/2021 Version 8: Ntuple removed.

25/3/2021 Version 14: Angle between e+ and e- from pair production added. 2D plot with energies of e+ and e-.

30/3/2021 Version 15: Test version: Trying to activate separately muNucl.

31/3/2021 Version 16: Physics list from TestEm17 added instead of the old one.

1/7/2021 Version 17: Optional changes: Graphite --> Carbon, detector thickness: 1.5 cm --> 1.3 cm

12/7/2021 Version 18: Muon energy changed from 150 GeV to 160 GeV.

26/7/2021 Version 19: Target's size changed to 10 cm X 10 cm X 1.3 cm. New physics list: FTFP_BERT_EMZ.

12/8/2021 Version 20: Debugging version: changed names of processes.

13/8/2021 Version 21: Add histograms related to muonNuclear and muBrems particles without any cuts.

15/8/2021 Assumption Version 22: Add a histograms of all processes without any cut.

16/8/2021 Version 23: More correlation plots added. Beam xy plot at the entrance and exit of the target added.

30/8/2021 Version 24: Bugs fixed from previous version.

31/8/2021 Version 25: Position of GPS changed.

1/9/2021 Version 26: In muon.mac: sigmas of GPS changed/added.

7/9/2021 Version 27: If case for filling in histogram 038 removed.

23/9/2021 Version 27a: Tests with a cut of 0.2 GeV instead of 1 GeV.
